TimThumb — PHP Image Resizer
=======

A small php script for cropping, zooming and resizing web images (jpg, png, gif). Perfect for use on blogs and other applications. You can read more about the script, along with TimThumb tutorials, on the [TimThumb Project Homepage](http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/projects/timthumb/).

## Important License Note

The conversation from 2013-10-04 on Twitter extends the applied GPL to a more liberal license.

Anatol’s [question](https://twitter.com/penibelst/status/386198036579237888):

> Don’t you want to (re-)release Timthumb under the MIT License? I’d love to include your library in my MIT licensed project.

> you're welcome to do whatever you like with it. Whatever I pick I have people asking me to change :)

Ben’s [clarification](https://twitter.com/BinaryMoon/status/386213834253688832):

> google code doesn't give many options so I picked what I know.
